You will be asked to convert a monster form Shadowdark ruleset into DnD 5e 2024
following the four stages of the translation process - Research, Draft, Refinement, Proofreed.
# Post-editing with local refinement
In this stage, the primary aim is to refine the draft statblock by making micro-level improvements that
improve the draft’s fluency and balance.
Provide only one refined translation and do not output anything else after that.
## Draft Translation
