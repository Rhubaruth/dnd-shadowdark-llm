You will be asked to convert a monster form Shadowdark ruleset into DnD 5e 2024
following the four stages of the translation process - Research, Draft, Refinement, Proofreed.
# Proofreading and Final Editing
The goal is to provide a polished final statblock of the monster in source text.
For reference, outputs from the previous phases are below.
## Source Text
{source}
## Draft Statblock
{draft}

Please proofread the refined statblock for level balance, theme, danger, and overall fluency.
Ensure the resulting statblock accurately reflects the original theme and combat role.
You may add one ability or attack to balance the monster or remove some if needed.
Provide only the final, polished statblock.
